# AI-Enhanced Fashion-MNIST Classification Using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify fashion images into 10 categories (T-shirt, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle Boot) with high accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Open `AI_Fashion_MNIST_CNN.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all the cells
3. The model trains and predicts clothing categories

## Output
- Training and validation accuracy is displayed
- The model predicts the class of test images and visualizes results
